# Advanced EEIO course notebooks

Exercises for the advanced course on EEIOA at Leiden University CML

## Learning goals of the course

- G1. Develop a more in-depth understanding of the IO tables and EEIOA from the EEIOA basics introduced in MAPP.
- G2. Articulate the advanced EEIOA techniques introduced in the course and their applications in sustainability research and decision-making.
- G3. Model in Python, and analyze the economic and environmental effects of production and consumption and potential policies across supply chains.
- G4. Develop and present a quantitative study using EEIOA, interpreting its main results and potential limitations.
